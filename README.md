# Deploy Heartistry's services using Docker Swarm
This project provides a comprehensive solution for deploying the Heartistry application using Docker Swarm. Heartistry is a multi-service platform that integrates user and task management, utilizes robust databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL), and includes advanced API management and monitoring tools. This deployment approach leverages Docker Swarm's orchestration capabilities to ensure scalability, high availability, and efficient resource utilization.

# Description

<image src="./deployment_model.svg"></input>
Heartistry's services are deployed using a set of Docker Swarm stacks to handle various components:
- **MySQL Database**: Used for task's data storage.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Used for user's data storage.
- **User's APIs**: Developed with NestJS, these APIs handle user-related operations such as authentication, user profiles, and other user-centric features.
- **Task's APIs**: Built with Spring Boot, these APIs manage English learning tasks, including vocabulary, sentences, and exercises.
- **Tyk API Gateway**: Serves as the API management layer to proxy requests and secure API interactions.
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: A powerful monitoring stack configured to monitor the health and performance of MySQL, PostgreSQL, Task's APIs, and the Tyk API Gateway.

# Technologies
1. **React**: Builds the user interface of the web app.
2. **Vite**: Bundles and optimizes frontend assets for fast development.
3. **Tyk API Gateway**: Routes, authenticates, and manages API requests.
4. **NestJS**: Implements the Auth/User Service for authentication and user management.
5. **Spring Boot**: Manages the Task Service for English learning tasks.
6. **PostgreSQL**: Stores user-related data for the Auth/User Service.
7. **MySQL**: Stores task-related data for the Task Service.
8. **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics for backend services monitoring.
9. **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics from Prometheus in a dashboard.
10. **Docker**: Containers backend services and databases for consistent deployment.
